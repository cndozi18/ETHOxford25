### **Privacy-Preserving Voting with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**

In a world where digital privacy is a growing concern, cryptographic techniques like **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** offer new ways to process sensitive data without exposing it. One exciting application is **secure voting**, where we need to count votes while ensuring individual privacy.  

### **Why This Matters**  
Traditional digital voting systems often require voters to trust a central authority to process and count votes correctly. However, this introduces risks such as **vote manipulation**, **leaks of sensitive data**, or **hacking attempts**. Our system eliminates these risks by ensuring:  
- **Votes remain encrypted** throughout the process.  
- **Tallying happens on encrypted data**, meaning no one—not even the election authority—can see individual votes.  
- **Only the final result is decrypted**, maintaining transparency while protecting voter privacy.  

### **Why It’s Interesting**  
This project showcases **the power of FHE**, a cutting-edge cryptographic technique that allows computations on encrypted data. Unlike traditional encryption, which requires decryption before processing, **FHE enables operations to be performed directly on encrypted data**—a breakthrough for privacy-focused applications like **healthcare, finance, and elections**.  

In essence, this project **demonstrates how we can build trustless voting systems** that ensure both security and transparency—potentially revolutionizing how democratic processes work in the digital age.
